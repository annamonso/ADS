# ADS – Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository showcases my implementations of core **data structures and algorithms**, with a focus on clean design, performance, and practical applications. It is organized by topic and demonstrates both foundational concepts and advanced algorithmic techniques.

## 📂 Contents

- **Introduction** – Fundamentals of algorithm analysis and complexity
- **Stacks & Queues** – Classic implementations and use cases
- **Priority Queues** – Heap-based structures and scheduling examples
- **Singly and Doubly Linked Lists** – Efficient node-based data storage
- **Binary Search Trees, Sets, Dictionaries** – Search, insertion, and dictionary abstractions
- **General and Binary Trees** – Traversals, recursive algorithms, and structural operations
- **Graphs** – Graph representations and algorithms (e.g., **topological sort**)
  
## 🚀 Highlights

- Implemented and tested **efficient algorithms** for data organization, search, and traversal.  
- Applied **graph theory** algorithms including **topological sorting**.  
- Designed and optimized **custom data structures** (linked lists, trees, queues).  
- Emphasized **readability, modularity, and scalability** in code structure.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**: Standard Python libraries only (self-contained implementations)  

## 💡 Purpose

This repository reflects my ability to:  
- Translate theoretical computer science concepts into **working software solutions**  
- Write clean and well-documented code suitable for **real-world applications**  
- Build a solid foundation for **advanced problem-solving, system design, and interviews**  

## ▶️ Usage

Clone the repository and run any module directly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/annamonso/ADS.git
cd ADS
python Graphs/topological_sort.py
```

## 📌 Notes
